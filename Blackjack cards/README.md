# 🃏 Blackjack Game (Python)

A **professional, text-based Blackjack game** implemented in Python.  
This project replicates the core logic of the classic **Blackjack (21)** card game, where the player competes against a computer dealer to achieve a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🎮 Fully playable single-player game  
- 🧠 Dealer logic implemented according to Blackjack rules  
- 🃠 Randomized card dealing using Python’s built-in `random` module  
- 📊 Real-time score calculation and win/loss display  
- 💻 Runs directly inside **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 🧩 Game Rules
1. Both player and dealer are dealt **two cards** initially.  
2. Number cards are worth their **face value**.  
3. **Face cards (J, Q, K)** are worth **10 points**.  
4. **Aces (A)** can count as **1 or 11**, depending on which benefits the hand.  
5. The player can **Hit** (draw another card) or **Stand** (end their turn).  
6. The dealer must continue drawing until their hand value is **17 or more**.  
7. The winner is determined by comparing hand values:
   - The closest to 21 without exceeding it **wins**.
   - If both hands have equal values, it’s a **draw**.
   - If the player or dealer goes above 21, they **bust** and lose the round.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- No external dependencies required beyond the standard `random` library.

📸 Example Output
Your cards: ['K♠', '7♦'] — Total = 17
Dealer's visible card: ['9♣']

Do you want to Hit or Stand? → Hit
You drew: '3♥'
Your total is now 20

Dealer's turn...
Dealer reveals: ['9♣', '6♠']
Dealer total = 15 → draws again
Dealer draws '5♦' → total = 20

Result: It's a draw!

🧠 Future Improvements

Add betting system and balance tracking

Create a GUI version using tkinter or pygame

Implement multiple players and AI enhancements
